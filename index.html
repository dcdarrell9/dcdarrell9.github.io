                <p>
                    As one of the initial DevOps engineers I joined the team at Infogrid at the end of 2020. 
                    My role at the company involves (but not limited to):
                    - Continuing to produce state of the art IaC, using Terraform.
                    - Automation of the infrastructure and all of the CI/CD.
                    - Being involved in the design and optimisation of the system and improving scalability.
                    - Implementing a monitoring solution for the system. (Including load/performance testing).
                    - Contributing to security best practices, and always looking for improvements.
                    - Making a difference!

                <h3>CGI</h3>
                <h4>DevOps Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    At CGI I was working on the Nerimnet project.
                    Nerimnet is the single national nuclear emergency monitoring solution for the
                    United Kingdom.

                    As part of the 4-person DevOps team, I was involved with using Terraform to 
                    stand up the multiple continuously-delivered and continuously-integrated 
                    environments within AWS, configuring Jenkins to enable the CI/CD functionality
                    and building Docker images and deploying them onto the various Docker Swarms 
                    as per standard in an n-tier application.

                    In addition to this visible work, I was heavily involved in identifying and
                    fixing security vulnerabilities in the solution, both before and after a
                    PenTest was conducted. Due to our proactive involvement, there were no critical
                    findings from the PenTest - a key piece of evidence to allow accreditation of 
                    the environments at Official level.

                    I achieved a promotion from Senior DevOps >> Principal DevOps during my time at CGI.

                <h3>QA Consulting</h3>
                <h4>IT Consultant</h4>
                <p>
                    I joined the QA team at the beginning of August 2016 and began training at the academy based in Manchester. I have been trained in Enterprise Architecture, Python, MySQL, DevOps and Big Data. 
                    Some of the technologies included Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Cloudera, Microsoft Azure.

                    After completing my training I worked on-site at the Office for National Statistics.

                    I contributed to the design, development and deployment of a number of services, mainly using the Python Flask web framework. 
                    I ensured that the 12 Factor Application principals were followed by reviewing code; Wrote unit, integration and feature test code; 
                    and worked on a number of different CI/CD pipelines for services using tools such as TravisCI, Concourse and Jenkins and Docker.

                    Whilst on site I was involved in multiple other technologies such as Django, Java, Postgres, AWS (EC2, ECS), Splunk, RabbitMQ and CloudFoundry, 
                    all while working in an agile environment.

                <p>
                    Whilst working in a school as an assistant network manager I have gained many different skills 
                    both personal and technical which include maintenance of hardware and software throughout the school 
                    and keeping a good relationship with external parties that the school are required to work with and provide support. 
                    Product ordering was part of my responsibilities and by cutting costs, I was able to save money for the school for other purposes.
